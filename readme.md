# AdventOfCode in F# and uiua

This is this time of the year again. [F#](https://fsharp.org) is still my favorite language to quickly solve 
the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. The interactive mode is awesome to scaffold code
and test continuously. The type checking signals early missteps, and the execution is fast.

This year, I tried [uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) for fun. I did not solved all days yet in this language,
because even if the final code is less than 10 lines long, learning a new language is time consuming.
However this is great fun, and the language tooling is really good.
